Project Name: Selsey House – Official Website

This is the second Milestone Project undertaken as part of the course for the Full stack developer certification from Code Institute. The requirement is to build an interactive front-end site that would respond to the users' actions, allowing them to actively engage with data and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. 

UX – 

London being one of the largest cities in Europe, attracts a vast number of travellers every year for business and sightseeing. Selsey House is a luxury bed and breakfast that is based in Kensington, central London. The purpose of the website is to showcase all the features and services of Selsey House that would appeal to potential customers. 

This is an extremely competitive business where users have hundreds of options to choose from. Hence, it is extremely important to grab the user’s interest within a few seconds before they lose interest. I have relied more on visual imagery and less text content to get the user’s attention. 

The principle purpose of the website is to solicit bookings from business and casual travellers who are looking for accommodation in Kensington, central London. The intention is to interact with customers, providing all the information they would potentially need to decide and make a booking.
