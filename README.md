PROJECT NAME: SELSEY HOUSE – OFFICIAL WEBSITE

This is the second Milestone Project undertaken as part of the course for the Full stack developer certification from Code Institute. The requirement is to build an interactive front-end site that would respond to the users' actions, allowing them to actively engage with data and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. 

UX – 

London being one of the largest cities in Europe, attracts a vast number of travellers every year for business and sightseeing. Selsey House is a luxury bed and breakfast that is based in Kensington, central London. The purpose of the website is to showcase all the features and services of Selsey House that would appeal to potential customers. 

This is an extremely competitive business where users have hundreds of options to choose from. Hence, it is extremely important to grab the user’s interest within a few seconds before they lose interest. I have relied more on visual imagery and less text content to get the user’s attention. 

The principle purpose of the website is to solicit bookings from business and casual travellers who are looking for accommodation in Kensington, central London. The intention is to interact with customers, providing all the information they would potentially need to decide and make a booking.

INTERACTIVE FEATURES - 

1. FORMS

We have two types of forms on the site; a check availability form on the footer of every page and a general enquiry form on the contact page. There is a check availability button on the header of every page that links down to the check availability form on the footer. 

Our intention is to provide the user with as much of a chance to fill out the check availabilty form without having to navigate towards it. (Keeping the visibility as high as possible.)

<img src="assets/images/screenshots/FooterForm-Clear.JPG" width=200> 

The general enquiry form on the contact page is to increase interactivity with the user so they can send a message, or provide a feedback or a suggestion. 

<img src="assets/images/screenshots/ContactForm-Clear.JPG" width=200> 

2. MAP

We have an interactive map on the footer of every page with some text that explains to the user how to use the map. Our intention is to display the central location of the property and the various amenities and attractions.

<img src="assets/images/screenshots/DesktopFooter.JPG" height = 300 width=800> <img src="assets/images/screenshots/MobileFooter1.JPG" width=200>   

3. GALLERY 

I think that visual imagery is the main deciding factor that influences decision making and leads to a booking. We have a gallery feature on the home and rooms page that allows the user to expand and browse all the images.

<img src="assets/images/screenshots/DesktopGallery.JPG" height = 300 width=800> <img src="assets/images/screenshots/MobileGallery.JPG" width=200>   

4. CURRENCY CALCULATOR

As we expect most of the users to be international travellers, we think its important to add a currency convertor feature so the user can convery the prices displayed, budget etc.
