This is the second Milestone Project undertaken as part of the course for the Full stack developer certification from Code Institute. The principle purpose of the website is to solicit bookings from business and casual travellers who are looking for accommodation in Kensington, central London.

UX – 

London being one of the largest cities in Europe, attracts a vast number of travellers every year for business and sightseeing. Selsey House is a luxury bed and breakfast that is based in Kensington, central London. The purpose of the website is to showcase all the features and services of Selsey House that would appeal to potential customers. The intention is to interact with customers, providing all the information they would potentially need to decide and make a booking.
